I maintain other repositories for separate Docker projects, that may be released to Docker Hub.

This repository includes only development files. I normally use these as replacements for the
projects' Dockerfiles. This is useful for me as a developer.

For example, in Skosmos the default Dockerfile does not include debugging and profiling
dependencies - which is reasonable - so I have a replacement here to hack away the code as
necessary.

Use at your own risk.
